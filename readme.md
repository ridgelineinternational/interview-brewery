## Brewery Service

The brewery service is a basic starter API written in Java Spring Boot. It exposes Swagger so a user may easily discover
and invoke endpoints. It makes use of the Open Brewery DB: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/

### Some ideas

* Implement more of the functionality found in the Open Brewery DB (
  documentation: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation)
* Implement things like paging, sorting, ordering, filtering, etc.
* Consider demonstrating solutions that may provide speed optimizations
* Consume this brewery API in an AngularJS application
